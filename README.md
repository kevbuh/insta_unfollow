# insta_unfollow
Little jupyter notebook to see who doesn't follow you

Go to you instagram account -> settings -> privacy and security -> download account info

Instagram will then proceed to send you an email with your account's data.

Unzip, and then go to ./login_and_account_creation/followers_and_following.

Then, go into followers.json and following.json and get the JSON objects from there. 

Finally, put your objects into the notebook and run every cell to see who doesn't follow you back.
